    topo -- Display topological information about the system.

    Usage: nvidia-smi topo [options]

    Options include:
    [-m | --matrix]: Display the GPUDirect communication matrix for the system.
    [-mp | --matrix_pci]: Display the GPUDirect communication matrix for the system (PCI Only).
    [-i | --id]: Enumeration index, PCI bus ID or UUID. Provide comma
                 separated values for more than one device
                 Must be used in conjuction with -n or -p.
    [-c | --cpu]: CPU number for which to display all GPUs with an affinity.
    [-n | --nearest_gpus]: Display the nearest GPUs for a given traversal path.
                   0 = a single PCIe switch on a dual GPU board
                   1 = a single PCIe switch
                   2 = multiple PCIe switches
                   3 = a PCIe host bridge
                   4 = an on-CPU interconnect link between PCIe host bridges
                   5 = an SMP interconnect link between NUMA nodes
                 Used in conjunction with -i which must be a single device ID.
    [-p | --gpu_path]: Display the most direct path traversal for a pair of GPUs.
                 Used in conjunction with -i which must be a pair of device IDs.
    [-p2p | --p2pstatus]:      Displays the p2p status between the GPUs of a given p2p capability
                   r - p2p read capabiity
                   w - p2p write capability
                   n - p2p nvlink capability
                   a - p2p atomics capability
                   p - p2p pcie capability

    [-C | --get-numa-id-of-nearby-cpu]: Displays NUMA ID of the nearest CPU for a GPU
                 Used in conjunction with -i which must be a single device ID.
    [-M | --get-numa-id-of-nearby-mem]: Displays NUMA ID of the nearest memory for a GPU
                 Used in conjunction with -i which must be a single device ID.
    [-gnid | --gpu-numa-id]: Displays NUMA ID of the specified GPU
                 Used in conjunction with -i which must be a single device ID.
    [-h | --help]: Display help information
